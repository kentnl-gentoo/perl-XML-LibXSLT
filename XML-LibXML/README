This module is a minimal interface to the Gnome libxml2 library which you
can find at http://www.xmlsoft.org/

Currently this is just a helper module for XML::LibXSLT (and as such is
included with the XML::LibXSLT distribution), but libxml2 has a full DOM
API, and so I hope to be able to offer full access to that API one day.
