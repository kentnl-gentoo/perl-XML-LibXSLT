This module is a fast XSLT library, based on the Gnome libxslt engine
that you can find at http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/

Performance is currently about twice that of XML::Sablotron (based on 
XSLTMark tests converted to Perl).

The libxslt processor is also highly standards compliant
implementation of XSLT 1.0.

A NOTE ON INSTALLATION
----------------------

Note that if you want any global data to be shared between the libxml2
libraries used by this module and XML-LibXML, e.g. the input callback
table, then each module must link dynamically against libxml2 so that
they both use the same shared library (this is in fact default on most
UNIX/POSIX platforms).

WIN32 BUILDING ISSUES
---------------------

It is recommended that when building this module on Win32 you also
link dynamically against libxslt and libexslt, since linking
statically against these libraries but dynamically against libxml2 may
cause some "unresolved symbol" linker errors.

Dynamic linking, however, causes a name clash between the name of this
module's DLL (LibXSLT.dll) and that of libxslt (libxslt.dll) on
Win32's case-insensitive filesystem. So, if you link dynamically then
you'll probably have to build your libxslt DLL as, say,
libxslt_win32.dll and then make the appropriate changes to this
module's build process to look for that instead of libxslt.dll.
