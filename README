This module is a fast XSLT library, based on the Gnome libxslt engine
that you can find at http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/

Performance is currently about twice that of XML::Sablotron (based on 
XSLTMark tests converted to Perl).

The engine is also quite complete in its implementation, supporting things
like xsl:import, and keys().

This is free software, you may use it and distribute it under the same
terms as Perl itself. Copyright 2001 AxKit.com Ltd, All rights reserved.
